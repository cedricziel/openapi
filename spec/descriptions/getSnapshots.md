These APIs can be used to retrieve information about hosts, processes, JVMs and other entities that we are calling snapshots. A snapshot represents static information about an entity as it was at a specific point in time. To clarify:
**Static information** is any information which is seldom changing, e.g. process IDs, host FQDNs or a list of host hard disks. The counterpart to static information are metrics which have a much higher change rate, e.g. host CPU usage or JVM garbage collection activity. Snapshots only contain static information.
- Snapshots are **versioned** and represent an entity's state for a specific point in time. While snapshots only contain static information, even that information may change. For example you may add another hard disk to a server. For such a change, a new snapshot would be created.
